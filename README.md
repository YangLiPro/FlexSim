# FlexSim
The Python workflow, which invokes Amber software for molecular dynamics simulations, is utilized for post-docking virtual screening. This process evaluates molecular enrichment by assessing the stability of ligands within the molecular pocket, calculating the binding free energy, and identifying critical interactions.
